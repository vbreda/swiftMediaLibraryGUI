# COSC346 - Assignment 2

## Learning Objectives

The goal of this assignment is to design and implement a GUI application.

## Problem Description

In this assignment you will design and implement a tool, using Cocoa, for managing the media library
from Assignment 1. You must allow the user of your software to open multiple media files together.

In addition to displaying the media files, the purpose of this application is to allow the user using the
software to record short notes connected to particular media file. While the means should be provided
to record notes in plain text about particular media file, persistent storage of this data is not essential
functionality but additional.
